This is an implementation of the model for the intrinsic covariance of projected density profiles of galaxy clusters described in Gruen et al., 2015, MNRAS, 449, 4, 4264. It provides the intrinsic covariance of kappa, gamma or DeltaSigma for a given set of annuli, a given mass and redshift.

See Makefile for installation instructions and send me <dgruen@stanford.edu> a note in case of any problems.

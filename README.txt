This is an implementation of the model for the intrinsic covariance of projected density profiles of galaxy clusters 
described in Gruen et al., 2015, MNRAS, 449, 4, 4264. It provides the intrinsic covariance of kappa for a given set 
of annuli, a given mass and redshift.

Coming soon: 
 -- uncorrelated LSS covariance
 -- choice of gamma_t instead of kappa covariance

See Makefile for installation instructions and send me <dgruen@usm.uni-muenchen.de> a note in case of any problems.
